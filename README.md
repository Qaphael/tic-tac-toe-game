## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## How to Play <a name="how-to-play"></a>

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The game board will be displayed on the screen, consisting of a 3x3 grid.
3. Two players take turns marking empty cells on the grid with their respective symbols: 'X' and 'O'.
4. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If all cells on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

## Implementation Details <a name="implementation-details"></a>

- The game logic is implemented in JavaScript (`script.js`), using HTML for the game board representation and CSS for styling.
- The game follows a simple turn-based system, where each player takes turns marking a cell until there is a winner or a draw.
- The game tracks the current player and highlights their turn on the screen.
- If a player wins or the game ends in a draw, a message will be displayed on the screen.
- Players can reset the game by clicking the "Reset" button.

## File Structure <a name="file-structure"></a>

- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles and layout for the game board.
